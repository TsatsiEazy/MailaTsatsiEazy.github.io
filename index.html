										was to invstigate and determine which countries had been impacted the most by COVID-19. Some of the questions 
										I had to answer questions such as, identifying which countries had highest, and lowest deaths and infections
										 by percentage relative to its population, with the data. Other questions were related to vaccinations.

								<h2>
									ABOUT ME
								</h2>
						    </header>	
							<p> In this section I am going to give a little bit of information on who I am and why you should seriously consider me as a viable candidate.
								As I have stated in my CV, I am hard working, motivated, ambitious, constantly wanting and willing to learn more on a humane level and career level albeit from various sources that present valid information
								whether it be informational articles or unorthodox methods such as learning via use of the AI tool Bard, and YouTube channels such as CareerFoundry, freeCodeCamp.org, AlexTheAnalyst, The Diary Of A CEO hosted by 
								Steven Bartlett and Financial Bunny as some of
								the educational formats I use to expand my horizon on both fronts, my young career in the field of data and self betterment.  
								I thrive working on my own but equally adept and comfortable in a team environment. If I was asked what are some important skills I picked up during varsity thus far
								the answer would be, Prioritising and Time Management because they may seem like 
								small concepts but if done right then they can result in huge benefits in the long run such as less overall stress during stressful times such as exams, and due dates as one won't 
								be under immense stress, with that being said. 
								I definitly can still working under stressful circumstances as I can and am able to hyperfocus and shut the noise out in order to complete my tasks.
								Anyhow, I hope this has sparked some curiosty about me and prompts you to reach out to have a conversation. 
								Thank you and have a blessed day. </a><br /><p>
